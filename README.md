Little app Discord for your daily forcecast

Here the sending time it 8PM UTC+1 and the location is in Rennes, FRANCE. You can change them in the dictionary `params`.  
You can use `!meteo` to get the graph whenever you want.
  
Add this app to your Discord channel by creating your own app and copy paste this code on it!  
Or with this link but I'm not shure it's working: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1185713807545344112&permissions=0&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000&scope=bot+applications.commands
